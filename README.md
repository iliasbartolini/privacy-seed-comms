Exploring intersections<br>
of human identity and<br>
its digital extensions<br>

## Leaflet back (en)

Privacy Seed is an installation to challenge the intersections <br>
of personal spaces and data privacy, the connection of <br>
human identity and its digital extensions.<br>
A wooden tree structure holds at its center an anatomical <br>
heart with a heartbeat sensor. By holding it in their hands <br>
the participants start interacting with the tree.<br>
The sensor readings are used to “seed” a secure digital <br>
random number generator that is one of the <br>
foundational elements of modern cryptography.

“Arguing that you don't care about  the right <br>
to privacy because you have nothing to hide <br>
is no different than saying you don't care about <br>
free speech because you have nothing to say.”<br>
                                             ― Edward Snowden

Participants are invited to answer the question that is on <br>
the front page of this leaflet. Their answers are collected <br>
on ribbons tied to the branches of the tree.<br>

Privacy Seed is a reflection on our personal-and-digital <br>
identity boundaries. It is an exploration of our intimate <br>
spaces and their public digital shadows.
